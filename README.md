# textimagexblock
XBlock for displaying text or image content

TODO:

- save type of xblock depending on which is chosen - image or text
- add more configuration options, such as text align etc
- save actual asset instead of just asset_url for retrieval (background image)
- put limit on file upload type and size (images up to ~4 MB or less)
- add support for video backgrounds

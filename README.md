# textimagexblock
XBlock for displaying text or image content

TODO:

- add tabs for choosing type image or text
- save type of xblock depending on which is chosen - image or text
- add more configuration options, such as text align etc
- add file upload instead of background_url
- save actual asset instead of just asset_url for retrieval (background image)
